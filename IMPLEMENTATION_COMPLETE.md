## 🏗️ Architecture Adherence

### IIFE Pattern (CommonJS-like)
All page scripts follow the established pattern:
```javascript
(function() {
    'use strict';
    // Page-specific state variables
    // init() function
    // renderPage() function
    // Helper render functions
    // attachHandlers() function
    // Modal functions
    // Auto-initialize on DOMContentLoaded
})();
```

### Shared Modules Used
All pages properly leverage:
- `Utils` - escapeHtml, formatDate, getDaysSince, showToast, formatBytes
- `Storage` - loadState, saveState, getStorageStats, getImportPreview
- `Models` - All CRUD operations for projects, ideas, logs, wins
- `ExportModule` - exportJSON, copyJSON, shareJSON, CSV exports, ICS exports
- `ImportModule` - importFromFile, importFromText, executeImport

### Navigation
- Traditional `<a href="page.html">` links
- Query parameters for dynamic content (`focus.html?id=abc123`)
- Breadcrumb navigation on focus page
- Active nav highlighting via `nav.js`

### State Management
- Each page calls `Storage.loadState()` independently
- No global state variable
- Atomic writes via TEMP_KEY → swap pattern
- Page re-renders after state changes

## 🎓 Key Implementation Decisions

1. **MPA over SPA**: Better debuggability, familiar patterns, clearer page boundaries
2. **IIFE over ES Modules**: CommonJS-like pattern, no build step needed
3. **Atomic Storage Writes**: TEMP_KEY → swap prevents corruption
4. **Project-Locked Modals**: Focus page modals can't change project (user request)
5. **Optional Reflection Notes**: Status changes encourage but don't require notes
6. **Required `learned` Field**: Learning log enforces minimum useful data
7. **Inline Next Step Edit**: Blur auto-save, other fields read-only for MVP
8. **Delete Confirmations**: All destructive actions have confirm dialogs
9. **Monthly Log Grouping**: Easier to scan than flat chronological list
10. **Import Preview**: Shows conflicts and allows merge strategy selection

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Browser Support**: Chrome 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 90+ (localStorage, ES6)
2. **Storage Limit**: ~5MB localStorage (adequate for 1000+ projects)
3. **No Sync**: Single-device storage, manual export/import for multi-device
4. **No Undo**: Destructive actions use confirm dialogs but can't be undone
5. **Read-Only Project Fields**: Focus page only allows next step edit (MVP scope)
6. **No Rich Text**: Plain text only (keeps it simple, fast, exportable)
7. **No Attachments**: Text-based only (fits localStorage constraints)
8. **No Collaboration**: Single-user tool (intentional scope)

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)

- [ ] Edit project details from focus page (title, why, beneficiaries)
- [ ] Rich text editor for notes
- [ ] Drag-and-drop file imports
- [ ] Bulk operations (archive multiple, batch export)
- [ ] Search across all entities
- [ ] Tags/labels for projects and ideas
- [ ] Statistics dashboard (charts, trends)
- [ ] Dark mode theme
- [ ] Offline service worker
- [ ] Desktop notifications
- [ ] Mobile app (PWA)

## 📝 User Testing Notes

**Testing Sequence Recommendation:**
1. Start fresh (clear all data)
2. Create 2-3 projects from dashboard
3. Navigate to one project (focus page)
4. Add 2-3 learning entries
5. Celebrate 1-2 wins
6. Change project status (observe optional reflection)
7. Edit next step (test inline save)
8. Export calendar
9. Go to Garden page
10. Capture 3-4 ideas
11. Assign one idea to existing project
12. Promote one idea to new project
13. Archive one idea
14. Go to Log page
15. Filter by project
16. Add learning entry from log page
17. Click review link
18. Go to Settings page
19. Download JSON backup
20. Export CSV files
21. Change preferences
22. Import backup (test merge)
23. Verify all data intact

**Focus Areas:**
- Modal flows (open, fill, submit, close)
- Delete confirmations (don't accidentally lose data)
- Filter/tab switching (state persists correctly)
- Auto-save behaviors (next step, preferences)
- Empty states (helpful, not confusing)
- Toast notifications (informative, not annoying)
