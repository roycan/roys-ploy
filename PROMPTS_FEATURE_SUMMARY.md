## User Experience

### Strengths & Support Workflow

3. Adds up to 10 support needs (e.g., "Accountability", "Technical expertise")
4. Optionally adds accountability partner with contact
5. Saves settings

### Per-Project Selection Workflow
1. User opens a project in Focus page
2. Clicks "Add them here" or "Edit" in strengths section
3. Modal shows checkboxes for global strengths/support needs
4. Selects up to 3 practice strengths
5. Selects up to 3 partner needs
6. Saves and sees chips displayed on Focus page

### Quarterly Plan Workflow
1. User clicks "View quarterly plan" link (Dashboard/Focus/Log)
2. Modal shows list of all quarterly plans
3. Clicks "New Plan" to create
4. Fills form:
   - Quarter label (e.g., "Q1 2025")
   - Goals
   - Success definition
   - Risks
   - Support plan
   - Mark as current (checkbox)
5. Can copy summary to clipboard
6. Can view/edit/delete past plans
7. Only one plan marked as "current" at a time

### On-Demand Access Points
- **Dashboard:** Above project list
- **Focus:** Between action buttons and tabs
- **Log:** Above weekly review card
- All links styled subtly (small grey text, underline on hover)

## Design Decisions

### No Cadence/Reminders
- Per user request: "no cadenceâ€¦ no reminders"
- Feature is purely on-demand
- User accesses when they "feel they need a push"

### Terminology
- **Settings:** "Support Needs" (global)
- **Projects:** "Partner Needs" (per-project)
- **Projects:** "Practice Strengths" (per-project)
- Avoids negative framing like "weaknesses"

### Limits
- Strengths: 10 maximum (enforced in UI)
- Support needs: 10 maximum (enforced in UI)
- Per-project practice strengths: 3 maximum
- Per-project partner needs: 3 maximum
- One quarterly reflection marked as "current"

### Data Persistence
- All data stored in localStorage
- Fully integrated with existing backup/export/import system
- `quarterlyReflections` merged by ID with "newest wins" strategy
- Settings fields included in standard merge

### Accessibility
- Links only appear when relevant (not on welcome screen)
- Clear helper text for new users
- "Go to Settings" link in edit modal if no global data exists
- Non-intrusive placement

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `scripts/shared/storage.js` - Data structure & merge logic
2. `scripts/shared/models.js` - CRUD functions & helpers
3. `scripts/pages/settings.js` - Strengths/support UI

7. `index.html` - Added prompts.js script
8. `focus.html` - Added prompts.js script
9. `log.html` - Added prompts.js script

### Files Created

### Code Quality

- Consistent naming conventions
- Defensive programming (array checks, null handling)

## Notes

### User-Centered Design
- Feature designed around user's stated preferences
- No forced cadence or reminders
- Optional at every level
- Subtle integration into existing workflows

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing data structures unchanged
- New fields default to empty arrays/objects

- Migration unnecessary for existing users

### Scalability
- Limits prevent data bloat
- Per-project selections keep focus narrow
- Quarterly reflections can grow over time
- No performance concerns with moderate use

## Support & Documentation

For users:
- In-app help text at key points
- Clear labels and placeholders
- Toast notifications for actions
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

For developers:
- Code follows existing patterns
