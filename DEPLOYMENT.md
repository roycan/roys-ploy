### Step 5: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub Actions will build and deploy your site (usually takes 1-2 minutes)

   echo "roysploy.yourdomain.com" > CNAME
   git add CNAME
   git commit -m "Add custom domain"
   git push
   ```

2. Configure DNS:
   - Add a CNAME record pointing to `<your-username>.github.io`
